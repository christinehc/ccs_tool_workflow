# Installation

First, install the main conda environment (`idpp`). Mamba is preferred, but conda can be used as well (but will be slower).

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then, activate the environment:

`conda activate idpp`

Next, install pip dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, manually install the following packages according to instructions in the home repos:

- DeepCCS

The above installation can be completed using `sbatch/hpc_setup.sbatch` if installing on Deception.

## GrAFF-MS

To install and use GrAFF-MS, use the associated environment spec.

`conda env create -f envs/graff-ms.yml`

You can also use `sbatch/graff-ms_setup.sbatch` to install the environment on Deception.

Then you will need to manually configure the path to the GrAFF-MS repository.

## Extra Installation Notes

- To install `torch_scatter`, first run `module load gcc/<newest_version>`
- Note that environment specs exist for many of the tools in the workflow, but the only tool requiring the user to pre-install its corresponding environment is GrAFF-MS (also DeepCCS requires the package to be installed in the main environment `idpp`).

# Getting Started

Before running the workflow, you must edit the configuration files to match your system. The following files require manual updating:

- config/cluster.yaml
- config/config.yaml
- profile/idpp.yaml

All parameters that require updating have their values in all uppercase (e.g. in config/config.yaml, the parameter `rtp_path` should be updated by replacing the uppercase text with the specified information: `rtp_path: RTP_REPOSITORY_PATH` -> `rtp_path: /path/to/rtp/`).

## HPC

Our HPC setup assumes Slurm is the system for submitting jobs for the cluster. Slurm parameters (in config/cluster.yaml and profile/idpp.yaml) are detailed in the [official Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).

# Running the Workflow

To run the workflow, simply use the [`snakemake` command](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html#all-options). We recommend the following options to start:

```bash
snakemake --jobs <N_JOBS> --latency-wait <WAIT> --scheduler greedy --use-conda --use-envmodules --directory <INPUT_DIRECTORY> --configfile config/config.yaml --cluster-config config/cluster.yaml --cluster "sbatch -A {cluster.account} -t {cluster.time} -J {cluster.name} --ntasks-per-node {cluster.ntasks} -p {cluster.partition}"
```

## Workflow Configuration

Parameters for running the general workflow are in the config/config.yaml file.

## Cluster Configuration

Parameters for running the general workflow are in the cluster/cluster.yaml file.
